# Sintropico

In the era of information, every sign is just an empty shell, remnant of what was once the true carrier of the real.

Where once the word was the seed for the world, now it is the pure representation of the world. 

We were reduced to mere symbols, mere replaceable characters that are transacted across multiple parts of this big computer crafted to the eternal accumulation of value.

Even where everything is thorn apart and the Absolute is crushed in infinitesimal pieces through informational chaos, wars, media manipulation and deceiving, dormant within the heart of each of this fragment lies the unsolvable glitch for this magnificent machine: some call life, some call love, some call consciousness. 

Here it comes to spread the message: Do not forget! This pulsation keeps living through all those who understand your True nature! 

Do not be deceived by the infinite 0s and 1s that is shown to you through beautifully conceived narcissistic mirrors.

Keep seeking your through nature! The truth can only be conceived by those who keep searching, keep living, keep loving and keep being conscious.

Do not forget - that you are just a dream of the Absolute.
